# TODO

- Block out main zones and animations
- Decide how to configure the landing page holds
    - Secondary navigation links
Document some of the Squarespace workarounds you're using
    - [Navigation links](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205814758-Using-links-in-your-navigation)
    - [Arbitrary files (e.g: SVG)](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205813928)
    - Info in odd places (e.g: [business info](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/212872328))
- Finish AJAX loading
    - Animation
- Design
    - Contact page
    - Event detail page
- Set up [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin/blob/webpack-1/README.md) with [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#webpack) and [LESS](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader)?
    - Currently working with Squarespace's weird divergent LESS implementation; prefixes etc are tricky.
    - Parking for now, as prefixing isn't as big an issue as it once was (for our current needs at least).
