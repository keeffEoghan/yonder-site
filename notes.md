# TODO

- Set up [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin/blob/webpack-1/README.md) with [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#webpack) and [LESS](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader)?
    - Currently working with Squarespace's weird divergent LESS implementation; prefixes etc are tricky.
    - Parking for now, as prefixing isn't as big an issue as it once was (for our current needs at least).
- Finish AJAX loading
    - Animation
- Design needs:
    - Contact page
    - Event detail page
- Decide how to configure the landing page holds
    - Navigation?
